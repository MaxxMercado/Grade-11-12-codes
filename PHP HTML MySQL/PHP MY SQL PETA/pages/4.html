            <p>Mohg, Lord of Blood is an extremely powerful Omen demigod specializing in blood magic, found in Mohgwyn Palace inside Siofra River. Unlike his twin Morgott, Mohg fully embraced his accursed Omen blood and was able to use it to wield bloodflame magic after encountering the Formless Mother. Though he himself is not an Empyrean, he hopes to rise up to king consort by raising Miquella up to godhood and becoming his consort. </p>

            <h1>ATTACK TO WATCH OUT FOR</h1>
            <h3>Bloodflame Talons</h3>
            <br>
            <img src="../Media/mohg gif.gif">
            <p>Mohg slashes an clawmark in the air with his left hand, which then explodes.
            He may also lunge forward with this attack.</p>
            <br>

            <h3> HOW TO DODGE </h3>
            <p>Roll away at the moment it detonates. Be careful if you're aggressively rolling into his spear swipes, as he can combo into this attack to roll-catch you.</p>
            <Br><p>1)The arc variant (horizontal swipe) is often used at medium range and can be rolled into.
<br>
                <br>2) The cone variant (over-shoulder swipe) can be dodged by rolling to the side.
           <Br>     
                <Br>3) The shower variant is performed if you're too close to him, and is used to force you away. You can circle behind him for a free hit before backing away.
        <br>        
               <br> 4) The Purifying Crystal Tear greatly decreases the damage from this attack and prevents you from bleeding out, while also reducing the amount of healing he does. This gives you the window to wail on him as you won't stagger from bleeding. Otherwise, you have to out-heal the bleeding from this attack.
