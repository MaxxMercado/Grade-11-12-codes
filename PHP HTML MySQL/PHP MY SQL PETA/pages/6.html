            <h1>"Thy strength befits a crown."</h1>
            <p>Godfrey was Queen Marika's first consort, and thus the first Elden Lord of the Lands Between. Before earning this title however, he was known as Hoarah Loux, the chieftain of the badlands and a bloodthirsty warrior. Godfrey took the Beast Regent Serosh upon his back after committing to his role as a Lord in order to suppress his violent urges. After fighting countless wars, Marika deprived him and his warriors of their grace, marking them as the first Tarnished.</p>

            <h1>ATTACK TO WATCH OUT FOR</h1>
            <h3>Hoarah Loux's Earthshake</h3>
            <br>
            <img src="../Media/godfreygif.gif">
            <p>A three-step move: First a roar that knocks targets down if it connects, directly followed by a leap. Upon impact, he slams his fist into the ground, creating a large shockwave. Finally, he plunges both arms into the ground, pulling them back out after a short delay. This causes energy to erupt from the ground in several places.</p>
            <br>

            <h3> HOW TO DODGE </h3>
            <p>Maintain distance during roar, time a dodge for the slam. As he is plunging his arms into the ground, clear the area of eruption.</p>
            <Br><p>1)Can easily be sidestepped or dodged due to its narrow hitbox
<br>
                <br>2) Dodge backwards or to the side to avoid the grab.
                This attack is often used after he knocked the player down with his kick, while they are immune to be grabbed.
           <Br>     
                <Br>3) Block; or dodge in the direction each attack comes from.
        <br>        
               <br> 4) Jump as his leg hits the ground, then avoid follow-up combos with additional jumps.
