            <h1>"The Golden Order "</h1>
            <p>Radagon is a tall, fractured god wielding the hammer that shattered the Elden Ring, and is found in the Elden Throne. He was previously married to Rennala, but became Queen Marika's consort after Godfrey was exiled from the Lands Between. Completing Brother Corhyn & Goldmask's quest to a certain point reveals that he is the "other half" of Queen Marika. Despite being of one body, the two do not share the same will, as evident from Radagon attempting to repair the Elden Ring after Marika had shattered it.</p>

            <h1>ATTACK TO WATCH OUT FOR</h1>
            <h3>Gold Breaker</h3>
            <br>
            <img src="../Media/ragdagongif.gif">
            <p>	Radagon jumps into the air, hovers for a moment as his hammer glows, then lunges down towards the player.</p>
            <br>

            <h3> HOW TO DODGE </h3>
            <p>Dodge towards Radagon as he lunges down. This avoids the AOE pulse of the attack, making it much easier to avoid.</p>
            <Br><p>1)The timing on this one is strange the attack lags and leaves you prone to panic rolling. Wait about two and a half seconds and then roll into Radagon.
<br>
                <br>2) Jump over or dodge to the side and keep distance from the bolt until it explodes
           <Br>     
                <Br>3) This is arguably the most irritating attack, as it can be chained quite often. Just dodge away from it.
        <br>        
               <br> 4)Two variations, including a regular slam with an AOE, or a dragging attack, which leaves behind a damaging field which later explodes.
