            <h1>"Thou, who approacheth Destined Death. I will not have it stolen from me again."</h1>
            <p>Maliketh is the second and final form of the Beast Clergyman who is found in Crumbling Farum Azula. The transitional cutscene shows the Clergyman's cloak being burnt off to reveal his armor and Maliketh pulling out the Black Blade from his left hand. Similar to how Blaidd is to Ranni, Maliketh is Queen Marika's shadow-bound beast. He was tasked to guard the Rune of Death, but his failure to do so led to the Night of the Black Knives. In order for this to never happen again, he imbued the rune into his very flesh.</p>

            <h1>ATTACK TO WATCH OUT FOR</h1>
            <h3>Black Blade</h3>
            <br>
            <img src="../Media/Malikethgif.gif">
            <p>Backflips into the air and slashes his sword at the player, blades will shoot from the blade towards the player at high speeds, can vary from 2-3 blades however, If it is 2 blades he will most likely follow with a Piledriver which has an AOE. If it is 3 blades he will charge towards player and perform the "Double Spin" attack while moving through the air.</p>
            <br>

            <h3> HOW TO DODGE </h3>
            <p>Do not panic roll, wait for about half a second after the slash begins to start rolling and count the slashes. If it is 2, copy the advice from the previous row. If it is 3, roll towards Maliketh when "Double Spin" is about to hit you. Since he is moving during the attack, the second slash will not hit you. Be careful not to stand close to an edge, since Maliketh will simply stop moving forward making the second hit near impossible to dodge. You can parry this attack on the descent with the Blasphemous Claw</p>
            <Br><p>1)Simple to roll through or block
<br>
                <br>2) Keep your shield up to reduce the impact, no damage is taken though.
                Alternatively, time a roll to avoid the impact.
           <Br>     
                <Br>3) The shower variant is performed if you're too close to him, and is used to force you away. You can circle behind him for a free hit before backing away.
        <br>        
               <br> 4) The Purifying Crystal Tear greatly decreases the damage from this attack and prevents you from bleeding out, while also reducing the amount of healing he does. This gives you the window to wail on him as you won't stagger from bleeding. Otherwise, you have to out-heal the bleeding from this attack.
