            <h1>"Put these foolish ambitions to rest."</h1>
            <p>Margit the self-proclaimed "Last of All Kings". He is found in Leyndell, Royal Capital. When he and his twin brother Mohg were born, they were imprisoned deep in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds for being born as Omen royalty. Despite how it treated him, Morgott still loved the Golden Order, and he defended the capital when his fellow demigods invaded during the Shattering. His loyalty was unfortunately not enough for him to be considered worthy of the Elden Throne, </p>

            <h1>ATTACK TO WATCH OUT FOR</h1>
            <h3>Holy Blade Rain</h3>
            <br>
            <img src="../Media/margit gif.gif">
            <p>Swings his staff in many directions with wind-ups ranging from fast to slow</p>
            <br>

            <h3> HOW TO DODGE </h3>
            <p>This short ranged melee attack is easy to back away from and avoid. You can often fit in an attack during the wind-up for the slower animations</p>
            <Br><p>1) Don't get too greedy when punishing a point in his combos that can transition to a Dagger Slash, since it comes out quickly. You can avoid it by staying behind him
<br>
                <br>2) Roll when you see a dagger appear in his hands. You can even dodge this just by running to the left or right
           <Br>     
                <Br>3) If you have a weapon with high bleed build-up (such as dual curved swords with Ash of War: Seppuku), the bleed effect will stagger her out of the Waterfowl Dance attack.
        <br>        
               <br> 4) This has a small radius, so dodge back to avoid it easily.
