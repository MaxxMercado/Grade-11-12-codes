    <p>Childhood friends Sasha and Marcus have a falling-out and don't speak for 15 years. But when Sasha, now a celebrity chef in Los Angeles, returns to her hometown of San Francisco to open a new restaurant, she runs into her old pal--a happily-complacent musician still living at home and working for his dad.
