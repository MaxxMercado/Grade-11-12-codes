    <h2>Legends Lyrics </h2> <br>
    <p>I usually don't speak on shit like this, but <br>
        Ain't nobody else saying shit <br>
        Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Chorus]<br>
        I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet <br>(This time)<br>
        Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence<br>
        This time, it was so unexpected<br>
        Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing<br>
        All legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh<br>
        Dying young, uh, demon youth<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Verse 1]<br>
        What's the 27 Club? We ain't making it past 21<br>
        I been going through paranoia, so I always gotta keep a gun<br>
        Damn, that's the world we live in now<br>
        Yeah, hold on, just hear me out<br>
        They tell me I'ma be a legend, I don't want that title now<br>
        'Cause all the legends seem to die out, what the fuck is this 'bout?<br>
        I'm tryna make it out, I'm tryna change the world<br>
        I'm tryna take her out, I'm tryna take your girl<br>
        More importantly, I'm tryna change the world<br>
        Maybe flex with some diamonds and pearls, yeah<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Chorus]<br>
        I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet <br>(This time)<br>
        Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence<br>
        This time, it was so unexpected<br>
        Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing<br>
        All legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh<br>
        Dying young, uh, demon youth<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2]<br>
        My mind is foggy, I'm so confused<br>
        We keep on losing our legends to<br>
        The cruel cold world, what is it coming to?<br>
        The end of the world, is it coming soon?<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Interlude]<br>
        Now, ooh, ooh, oh<br>
        That hit's for you<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Chorus]<br>
        I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet<br> (This time)<br>
        Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence<br>
